# Changelog

All notable project specification and repository-workflow changes are recorded here.

## [2.3] - 2026-07-12

### Changed

- Replaced requirements and roadmap Version 2.2 with Version 2.3.
- Adopted private GitHub Enterprise Cloud source control for `KCs IRA Dash - Monte Carlo/Portfolio-Dashboard`.
- Standardized VS Code 1.106.3, the Codex extension connected to ChatGPT Plus,
  the integrated terminal and Source Control view, and Git over SSH for repository operations.
- Defined `main` as accepted source, phase branches and pull requests for development, Actions checks, accepted tags, and milestone releases.
- Changed the Finnhub key policy to the predefined editable value maintained in
  `requirements.md`.
- Permitted the key in source, repository history, documentation, fixtures, logs, diagnostics, URLs, exports, backups, screenshots, and releases.
- Permitted the eight Stooq production files, backups, exports, and diagnostics in the private repository.
- Made browser test pages the primary acceptance tests and CI/Node checks supplemental.
- Required Codex to edit and validate the authorized workspace directly while preserving unrelated changes.
- Added phase-by-phase VS Code, Codex, Git, and GitHub execution instructions from Phase 3B through Phase 10B.

### Status

- Phase 3A: accepted baseline.
- Version 2.3 key migration: implemented for the consolidated baseline.
- Phase 3B: next roadmap phase; it has not started, and its implementation and
  tests are not present in this baseline.
- Phase 1D: deferred until target home Wi-Fi is available.
