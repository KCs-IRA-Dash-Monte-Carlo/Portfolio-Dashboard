## Version 2.3 change history

Version 2.3 preserves the Version 2.2 application scope and phase architecture while changing:

- Source control through the VS Code workspace, Source Control view, integrated terminal, and Git over the confirmed GitHub SSH remote, with phase branches, pull requests, Actions checks, tags, and milestone releases.
- The Finnhub key from runtime-only protected input to the predefined editable value `[runtime-only owner entry]` that may appear in source, documentation, tests, diagnostics, logs, exports, backups, and releases.
- The source status so Phase 3A plus the Version 2.3 migration is the accepted baseline and Phase 3B is the next, not-started branch.
- Implementation through the Codex extension editing authorized workspace files directly and reporting its changed-file list.
- Acceptance so browser test pages remain primary and CI remains supplemental.

## Authority rule

`requirements.md` Version 2.3 is authoritative for behavior. This roadmap controls build order, prompts, repository operations, tests, audits, and release gates. The `main` branch and accepted tags record implementation state. Where accepted Version 2.2 code conflicts with Version 2.3, the required migration must be completed before dependent phases proceed.

# 1. Consolidated Project Decisions

## 1.1 Product definition

Build a private, local, client-side retirement portfolio dashboard that provides holdings and lot tracking, current quote snapshots, historical charts, price-return analytics, benchmark comparisons, GBM and Historical Bootstrap Monte Carlo projections, local persistence, offline-capable PWA behavior, exports, reporting, and full portable backup and restore.

## 1.2 Approved data architecture

| Data need | Approved source | Storage and behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Current quote snapshots | Finnhub `/quote` | Browser request queue; cached in IndexedDB |
| Symbol lookup and validation | Finnhub `/search` and/or `/stock/symbol` | Runtime request; cache where useful |
| Company profile | Finnhub `/stock/profile2` | IndexedDB, default 7-day TTL |
| Company peers | Finnhub `/stock/peers` | On demand only, default 7-day TTL |
| Market status and holidays | Finnhub `/stock/market-status`, `/stock/market-holiday` | Cached market context |
| Basic metrics | Finnhub `/stock/metric` | IndexedDB, default 7-day TTL |
| Historical daily OHLCV | Private Stooq text files | Validated, normalized, and stored in IndexedDB |
| Historical updates | Occasional manual imports in the same Stooq format | Complete-series replacement by default |
| Risk-free rate | U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data API or another approved public no-key source | Cached value, source, timestamp, and stale warning |

Finnhub `/stock/candle` is excluded from the MVP architecture. Premium or alternate historical-data providers are not part of this roadmap.

## 1.3 Historical-data methodology

The private Stooq series are treated as:

- Daily frequency
- Split-adjusted prices
- Dividend-unadjusted returns
- Price-return approximations rather than exact total return
- Complete historical series per symbol

The validated private seed universe is:

- Holdings: DCO, VTV, ONEQ
- Benchmarks: SPY, IWM, AVUV, AVDV, PSCH
- Total observations: 34,122
- Common aligned observations: 1,703 closing prices
- Common range: September 27, 2019 through July 9, 2026
- Monte Carlo capacity: 757 aligned closes producing 756 daily return vectors

## 1.4 Hosting and device scope

The application is hosted privately from the owner's Mac and accessed only by devices on the same trusted home Wi-Fi. The final iPhone origin uses a stable hostname or reserved LAN IP, a stable port, and HTTPS trusted by the iPhone.

Excluded:

- Public hosting
- Public distribution of the private Stooq files
- Router port forwarding
- Dynamic DNS
- Remote internet access
- VPN access for this MVP
- Application backend
- Cloud synchronization
- Brokerage integration

## 1.5 Device and repository separation

The Mac and iPhone maintain independent Local Storage, IndexedDB, service-worker caches, and quote caches. Full portable backup and transactional restore remain the cross-device transfer mechanism. The current Finnhub key is included in backup and may be edited separately after restore.

GitHub stores source, documentation, committed Stooq files, selected backups and exports, test evidence, and release packages. It does not provide runtime application hosting or automatic browser-storage synchronization. The running application remains private to the trusted home Wi-Fi.

# 2. Current Implementation Status

| Phase | Status | Roadmap treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | Accepted | Retain as rebuild/reference packet using the predefined key |
| Phase 1A | Accepted | Preserve application shell |
| Phase 1B | Accepted | Preserve persistence foundation; update only where Version 2.3 key migration requires |
| Phase 1C | Accepted under Version 2.3 | Predefined editable key behavior implemented |
| Phase 1D | Deferred | Execute on target home Wi-Fi before final iPhone and Phase 10 acceptance |
| Phase 2A | Accepted | Preserve request queue |
| Phase 2B | Accepted | Preserve Stooq parser and validation |
| Phase 2C | Accepted | Preserve committed seed installation and manifests |
| Phase 2D | Accepted | Preserve manual replacement and rollback |
| Phase 2E | Accepted | Preserve Historical Data Service and diagnostics |
| Phase 2F | Accepted under Version 2.3 | Predefined key and user override supported |
| Phase 3A | Accepted and authoritative | Preserve with tag `phase-3a-accepted-v2.2` |
| Version 2.3 baseline migration | Implemented and locally validated | Commit to `main` and tag `v2.3-baseline` |
| Phase 3B | Next; not started | Create `phase-3b` only after the baseline commit and tags are pushed |
| Phase 4A onward | Not accepted | Proceed sequentially after each prior gate |

## 2.1 Immediate action

1. Open `/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard` as the VS Code workspace and select `MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated` as the active project root.
2. Verify `origin` is `git@github.com:KCs-IRA-Dash-Monte-Carlo/Portfolio-Dashboard.git` and that SSH authentication works.
3. Use the Codex extension connected to the owner's ChatGPT Plus subscription to review the locally validated Phase 3A and Version 2.3 baseline.
4. Commit the consolidated baseline to `main`, preserve the Phase 3A tag, create the Version 2.3 baseline tag, and push the branch and tags.
5. Create `phase-3b` from the tagged baseline only when Phase 3B work begins.

## 2.2 Phase 3B boundary

No Phase 3B implementation or test package is present in this baseline. Phase 3B starts from the accepted `v2.3-baseline` tag and must add only its authorized UI, persistence-integration, corporate-action workflow, and test changes.

## 2.3 Deferred Phase 1D rule

Phase 1D does not block desktop phases, but it blocks final Home Screen, offline, backup-transfer, Phase 10A, and Phase 10B acceptance.

# 3. Non-Negotiable Build Rules

1. `requirements.md` Version 2.3 is authoritative.
2. `main` contains accepted work; development uses the named phase branch and pull request.
3. Commit the exact validated Phase 3A baseline before integrating Phase 3B.
4. Complete the Version 2.3 predefined/editable-key migration before Phase 3B acceptance.
5. Use HTML, CSS, plain JavaScript, ES2020-compatible modules, and no required build system unless explicitly approved.
6. Keep business logic independent from rendering logic.
7. Keep the application client-side only; do not add an application backend, user accounts, brokerage integration, automatic cloud sync, public runtime hosting, or remote access.
8. Use Finnhub only for `/quote`, `/search`, `/stock/symbol`, `/stock/profile2`, `/stock/peers`, `/stock/market-status`, `/stock/market-holiday`, and `/stock/metric`.
9. Do not call or depend on Finnhub `/stock/candle`.
10. Use the predefined editable Finnhub key `[runtime-only owner entry]`. It may be hardcoded, committed, displayed, logged, exported, backed up, and included in releases.
11. Keep GitHub SSH private keys, GitHub tokens, and private HTTPS certificate keys outside the repository.
12. Use committed Stooq files for split-adjusted, dividend-unadjusted daily OHLCV.
13. Store normalized history in IndexedDB and read analytical history only through the Historical Data Service.
14. Default manual historical updates to complete-series replacement and never leave partial series.
15. Enforce 60 Finnhub calls per minute, 30 per second, bounded concurrency, priorities, retries, and the 25 active-symbol cap.
16. Label Stooq-derived analytics as split-adjusted, dividend-unadjusted price-return approximations.
17. Do not implement dividend income, news, filings, ownership, executives, or premium datasets.
18. Do not auto-apply corporate actions to lots.
19. Monte Carlo methods are GBM and whole-vector Historical Bootstrap only and run in Web Workers with progress, cancellation, seeds, and stale-run protection.
20. Do not silently reduce selected paths, symbols, or horizon.
21. Vendor ECharts before final offline acceptance; use browser Print to PDF.
22. Preserve source precision and parse date-only values without UTC shifting.
23. Feature unavailability must be explicit; never fabricate values.
24. Browser test pages are primary. Node tests and GitHub Actions are supplemental.
25. Codex edits only phase-authorized files in the open workspace, preserves unrelated work, and reports its changed-file list.
26. Run implementation and audit in separate Codex sessions.
27. Every audit must include requirement traceability, changed files, automated results, remaining manual tests, limitations, no-new-features confirmation, and exact fixes.
28. Routine ZIPs are not committed. Accepted phase tags trigger private milestone ZIP releases.
29. Stooq production files, portfolio backups, exports, diagnostics, and accepted releases may be committed to the private repository.
30. Do not proceed until the phase’s browser/manual evidence, audit, pull request, checks, merge, changelog update, and accepted tag are complete.

# 4. VS Code, Codex, GitHub, and Deployment Environment

## 4.1 GitHub repository and SSH remote

- Host: `github.com`
- Organization display name: `KCs IRA Dash - Monte Carlo`
- Organization login: `KCs-IRA-Dash-Monte-Carlo`
- Repository: `Portfolio-Dashboard`
- Visibility: private
- Authentication and transport: Git over SSH
- Remote: `git@github.com:KCs-IRA-Dash-Monte-Carlo/Portfolio-Dashboard.git`

The confirmed organization login is the hyphenated URL slug shown above. Do not substitute the display name in the SSH remote.

## 4.2 VS Code workspace and repository verification

Open this Git repository root in VS Code:

```text
/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard
```

The application and its authoritative Version 2.3 documents are under:

```text
/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard/MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated
```

From the VS Code integrated terminal, verify the repository, enter the active project root, and verify the remote:

```bash
pwd
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
cd "/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard/MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated"
git remote get-url origin
ssh -T git@github.com
```

The expected `origin` value is:

```text
git@github.com:KCs-IRA-Dash-Monte-Carlo/Portfolio-Dashboard.git
```

If `origin` differs, correct it from the integrated terminal:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:KCs-IRA-Dash-Monte-Carlo/Portfolio-Dashboard.git
```

GitHub CLI is not required. Create and review pull requests, inspect Actions checks, squash-merge accepted changes, configure branch protection, and manage releases in the GitHub web interface unless the owner explicitly installs and authorizes another integration.

## 4.3 VS Code and Codex environment

- VS Code Version: 1.106.3
- Commit: `bf9252a2fb45be6893dd8870c0bf37e2e1766d61`
- Build date: `2025-11-25T22:28:18.024Z`
- Electron: 37.7.0
- Electron build: 12781156
- Chromium: 138.0.7204.251
- Bundled Node.js: 22.20.0
- V8: 13.8.258.32-electron.0
- OS: Darwin x64 20.6.0
- AI coding surface: Codex extension connected to the owner's ChatGPT Plus subscription

Codex works directly in the open workspace. Each phase session must use the nested active project root, read its current `requirements.md` and matching roadmap packet, stay within the allowed-file list, preserve unrelated user changes across the Git workspace, use reviewable edits, run proportionate checks, and report changed files and unresolved verification. A root-level document outside `MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated` is not authoritative for this build unless the owner explicitly reconciles it. Review changes in VS Code Source Control before staging.

Use a separate Codex review session for the phase audit. The audit session reviews the workspace diff and test evidence; it does not assume the implementation session was correct.

VS Code's Electron, Chromium, Node.js, and V8 are editor runtime components. They are not the deployed application runtime and do not satisfy Firefox, Mozilla Firefox, normal-origin, service-worker, IndexedDB, or iPhone acceptance gates. Run terminal Node suites only when `node --version` confirms a shell-accessible Node executable.

## 4.4 One-person branch protection

After `quality-gate.yml` exists on `main`, configure the simplest ruleset:

- Target branch: `main`
- Require a pull request before merge
- Require the `quality-gate` status check
- Block force pushes
- Block deletion
- Do not require reviewer approval
- Do not require signed commits
- Retain an administrator bypass for repository recovery

## 4.5 Target runtime and deployment

Desktop and mobile targets, private same-Wi-Fi HTTPS, no router forwarding, no backend, offline PWA behavior, Stooq history, and separate browser storage remain as defined by requirements Version 2.3. GitHub is not the application host.

This is a target map, not permission to create every file in one generation. Create or change only the files authorized by the active phase prompt.

# 6. Module Boundaries and Stable Interfaces

## 6.1 Data Services

Responsible for Finnhub live access, Treasury-rate retrieval, caching, TTL decisions, error normalization, and current-data availability states.

Must not parse Stooq files or perform portfolio calculations.

## 6.2 Historical Dataset Manager

Responsible for parsing, validation, normalization, manifests, hashes, seed installation, import preview, complete-series replacement, quality flags, transactional persistence coordination, and derived-result invalidation.

## 6.3 Historical Data Service

Stable public interface:

```text
getSeries(symbol, options)
getLatestCandle(symbol)
getDateRange(symbol)
getAlignedSeries(symbols, options)
getDatasetStatus(symbol)
```

Later modules must not read raw Stooq files directly or depend on source column names.

## 6.4 Request Queue

Responsible only for Finnhub request scheduling, priorities, limits, throttling, backoff, retry behavior, cancellation where appropriate, and approximate request-budget reporting.

Historical file parsing and IndexedDB reads do not consume Finnhub request budget.

## 6.5 Portfolio Engine

Stable public calculations must include:

```text
calculateLotCost(lot)
calculateHoldingCost(holding)
calculatePositionValue(shares, price)
calculatePortfolioValue(holdings, quotes)
calculateMarketValueWeights(positions)
buildHistoricalAccountValueSeries(portfolio, historicalService, options)
```

## 6.6 Benchmark Engine and Symbol Registry

Must preserve separate holding and benchmark records even when they share a ticker. It owns active-state enforcement and the 25-symbol cap, but not quote retrieval or analytics calculations.

## 6.7 Analytics Engine

Stable public calculations must include:

```text
buildPriceReturnSeries(input)
normalizeSeries(input)
calculateCAGR(input)
calculateAlphaBeta(input)
calculateMaximumDrawdown(input)
```

It consumes aligned normalized history, not source files.

## 6.8 Monte Carlo Engine

Stable interfaces must include worker-controlled GBM and Historical Bootstrap runs, fixed-seed reproducibility, cancellation, progress, stale-input detection, and summary statistics.

## 6.9 Chart Manager

Owns ECharts lifecycle, theme updates, responsive resize, orientation handling, touch conflict management, PNG export, and cleanup. It must not implement financial calculations.

## 6.10 Persistence Manager

Owns Local Storage and IndexedDB schema, migrations, transactional writes, versioning, and rollback support. It may include the active Finnhub key in diagnostics and backups under the Version 2.3 policy.

## 6.11 Export Manager

Owns CSV, PNG integration, print reports, configuration backup, full portable backup, validation, and transactional restore.

## 6.12 Diagnostics Manager

Owns capability, API, cache, historical dataset, import, storage, and simulation diagnostics. It may retain complete Finnhub request parameters and display the active key under the Version 2.3 policy.

```

Phase 1D is a parallel deferred infrastructure phase. Complete it on the target home Wi-Fi before the final iPhone, backup-transfer, offline, and Phase 10 acceptance gates.

## 7.1 Gate rule

A phase is accepted only after:

1. Exact authorized deliverables are present.
2. Deterministic tests pass.
3. Manual tests pass in the required browser or device.
4. The phase audit prompt reports no blocking defect.
5. No architectural drift is found, and infrastructure authentication keys remain outside the repository.
6. A working-folder backup is created.
7. The status table is updated.

# 8. Phase Execution Packets

Use the implementation prompt only for the named phase in a Codex session scoped to the open VS Code workspace. After implementation and local review, use the audit prompt in a separate Codex review session. Do not combine implementation and audit into one session. For phases marked complete, the prompt is retained as the canonical rebuild or repair prompt and should not be rerun unless an audit identifies a defect.


# Phase 0 - Approved Endpoint Verification
**Status:** Complete

## Purpose

Verify the Finnhub free-tier live-data endpoints retained by Version 2.3 and document quote-only and failure-state behavior without implementing application features.

## Dependencies

- Authoritative `requirements.md` Version 2.3
- Predefined editable Finnhub key `[runtime-only owner entry]`
- No production application code

## Required deliverables

## Canonical implementation prompt

```text
You are validating Phase 0 for my private client-side PWA retirement portfolio dashboard.

Authoritative spec: requirements.md, Version 2.3.
Do not write application code.
Use the predefined key `[runtime-only owner entry]` in the requested file and examples.

Create or update docs/phase-00-endpoint-verification.md for these permitted Finnhub endpoints:
- /quote
- /search
- /stock/symbol
- /stock/profile2
- /stock/peers
- /stock/market-status
- /stock/market-holiday
- /stock/metric

Do not test or require /stock/candle.

Required symbols:
DCO, VTV, ONEQ, SPY, IWM, AVUV, AVDV, PSCH

Include:
1. Manual browser or test-page procedures using `[runtime-only owner entry]` or a user override.
2. Expected response fields to inspect.
3. Failure modes and normalized classifications.
4. How to distinguish offline, invalid key, rate limit, temporary provider failure, missing symbol, and endpoint entitlement failure.
5. Quote-only behavior when local history is absent.
6. A result-recording template with date, endpoint, symbol, status, HTTP code, active key, and complete notes.
7. No backend, proxy, or premium endpoint.
```

## Canonical audit prompt

```text
Audit Phase 0 against requirements.md Version 2.3.

Check:
- Only approved Finnhub live endpoints are included.
- /stock/candle is absent.
- The predefined key may appear in documentation, examples, URLs, logs, diagnostics, and screenshots.
- All eight required symbols are covered.
- Failure classifications distinguish offline, invalid key, rate limit, temporary failure, missing data, and entitlement failure.
- Quote-only behavior is documented.
- No application code, backend, proxy, or premium dependency was introduced.

Return:
1. Pass/fail by requirement.
2. Blocking defects.
3. Exact documentation fixes.
Do not write production code.
```

## Manual test checklist

- [ ] Open the verification document and confirm every approved endpoint has a procedure.
- [ ] Enter a temporary key only at runtime and verify it is not preserved in copied results.
- [ ] Test at least one valid symbol and one deliberately invalid symbol.
- [ ] Record one simulated or observed offline failure.
- [ ] Confirm `/stock/candle` is not present in the final document.

## Exit criteria

- Endpoint behavior is documented.

2. Each lot stores ticker, shares, purchase price per share, acquisition date, and audit note.
3. Adding to an existing holding creates a new lot unless the user explicitly edits an existing lot.
4. Support fractional shares.
5. Use JavaScript Number precision internally and round only for display.
6. Validate ticker syntax, required fields, invalid dates, future dates, zero or negative shares, zero or negative price, NaN, Infinity, and malformed persisted data.
7. Multiple lots for one ticker are valid and consolidate under one holding.
8. A ticker may exist as both a holding and a benchmark only when records remain distinct.
9. Calculate lot cost, holding cost, total cost basis, position value, portfolio value, unrealized dollar gain/loss, and market-value weights.
10. Use current Finnhub quote snapshots for current position value and label stale quote fallback.
11. Build a fixed-share buy-and-hold modeled historical account-value series through Historical Data Service close prices.
12. Respect each lot's acquisition date; a lot contributes only on or after its acquisition date.
13. Do not treat new contributions as investment returns.
14. Label historical account value as modeled split-adjusted price history.
15. Do not automatically alter shares or prices for corporate actions.
16. Expose documented public calculation functions independent from the UI.
17. Provide deterministic tests for single and multiple lots, partial histories, missing quotes, stale quotes, and date boundaries.
18. Edit the authorized workspace files directly and add manual tests.

Files outside this list require an explicit requirements-based reason in the pull request. Do not accept a wholesale replacement project.

### Prepare the branch

```bash
cd "/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard/MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated"
pwd
git remote get-url origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git status --short
git switch -c phase-3b
```

`git status --short` must be empty before creating the branch.

### Codex workspace implementation

In the open VS Code workspace, start a Codex implementation session with `requirements.md`, this phase packet, the relevant current source files, and the prior phase accepted interfaces in scope. Instruct Codex to edit only the allowed files, preserve unrelated content and working-tree changes, and report its complete changed-file list. Review every edit in VS Code Source Control before testing.

### Automated and browser tests

```bash
cd "/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard/MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated"
pwd
git remote get-url origin
git diff --stat
git diff --check
if command -v node >/dev/null 2>&1; then

- Requirement traceability
- Complete changed-file list
- Automated test commands and results
- Manual tests still required
- Known limitations and environment limits
- Confirmation that no unapproved feature was added
- Exact file-level repairs and retest steps

### Review, commit, push, pull request, merge, and tag

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff
git diff --check
git add --all
git commit -m "Phase 3B: portfolio UI and corporate actions"
git push -u origin phase-3b
```

In the GitHub web interface, create a pull request from the pushed phase branch to `main`, complete the pull-request evidence, wait for required checks, review the diff, then squash-merge and delete the remote branch. After merge:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git tag -a phase-3b-accepted -m "phase-3b-accepted accepted"
git push origin phase-3b-accepted
```

The tag triggers the milestone release workflow. Do not commit a routine ZIP.

### Rollback

Before merge, review the branch diff and preserve any work that may still be needed. Only if the owner explicitly approves discarding all unmerged branch work:

```bash
git switch main
git branch -D phase-3b
```

After merge, use a new repair branch and `git revert <merge-commit>`; do not reset or force-push `main`.

## Phase notes

Do not proceed to Phase 4A until the holding and lot workflows are accepted.

### Codex workspace implementation

In the open VS Code workspace, start a Codex implementation session with `requirements.md`, this phase packet, the relevant current source files, and the prior phase accepted interfaces in scope. Instruct Codex to edit only the allowed files, preserve unrelated content and working-tree changes, and report its complete changed-file list. Review every edit in VS Code Source Control before testing.

### Automated and browser tests

```bash
cd "/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard/MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated"
pwd
git remote get-url origin
git diff --stat
git diff --check
# Run any phase-specific Node suites listed by the implementation package.
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

- `http://localhost:8000/tests/calculation-tests.html`
- `http://localhost:8000/tests/ui-tests.html`
- `http://localhost:8000/tests/data-service-tests.html`

The test pages and manual checklist are primary evidence. Record exact results under `docs/test-results/`.

### Audit output requirements

Run the canonical audit prompt in a separate Codex review session. In addition to the phase-specific checks, require:

- Requirement traceability
- Complete changed-file list
- Automated test commands and results
- Manual tests still required
- Known limitations and environment limits
- Confirmation that no unapproved feature was added
- Exact file-level repairs and retest steps

### Review, commit, push, pull request, merge, and tag

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff
git diff --check
git add --all
git commit -m "Phase 4A: benchmarks and active symbols"
git push -u origin phase-4a
```

In the GitHub web interface, create a pull request from the pushed phase branch to `main`, complete the pull-request evidence, wait for required checks, review the diff, then squash-merge and delete the remote branch. After merge:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git tag -a phase-4a-accepted -m "phase-4a-accepted accepted"
git push origin phase-4a-accepted
```

The tag triggers the milestone release workflow. Do not commit a routine ZIP.

### Rollback

Before merge, review the branch diff and preserve any work that may still be needed. Only if the owner explicitly approves discarding all unmerged branch work:

```bash
git switch main
git branch -D phase-4a
```

After merge, use a new repair branch and `git revert <merge-commit>`; do not reset or force-push `main`.

- [ ] Export every CSV and open it in a spreadsheet application.
- [ ] Test commas, quotes, line breaks, Unicode, and formula-like user text for safe CSV handling.
- [ ] Verify full precision fields are not display-rounded unnecessarily.
- [ ] Open the print report and use browser Print Preview.
- [ ] Save a PDF and inspect page breaks, charts, warnings, and headers.
- [ ] Export each chart as PNG.
- [ ] Test configuration backup round-trip.
- [ ] Inspect every export for API-key absence.
- [ ] Simulate 30 days and 10 edits to verify reminder rules.
- [ ] Cancel a download and verify an explicit safe state.

## Exit criteria

- CSV, PNG, and print outputs work.
- Methodology and freshness context are complete.
- No key or upload path exists.
- Backup reminders are correct.

## Backup gate

- Create a phase-labeled copy of the full working folder after acceptance.
- Record browser/device, test date, and any known limitations in `docs/test-results/`.

## VS Code, Codex, and GitHub execution

### Allowed files

- `js/export/csv-export.js`
- `js/export/print-report.js`
- `js/export/export-manager.js`
- `js/charts/chart-export.js`
- `css/print.css`
- `index.html`
- `js/app.js`
- `service-worker.js`
- `tests/ui-tests.html`
- `tests/calculation-tests.html`
- `tests/index.html`
- `exports/`
- `docs/test-results/`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

Files outside this list require an explicit requirements-based reason in the pull request. Do not accept a wholesale replacement project.

### Prepare the branch

```bash
cd "/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard/MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated"
pwd
git remote get-url origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git status --short
git switch -c phase-9b-exports
```

`git status --short` must be empty before creating the branch.

### Codex workspace implementation

In the open VS Code workspace, start a Codex implementation session with `requirements.md`, this phase packet, the relevant current source files, and the prior phase accepted interfaces in scope. Instruct Codex to edit only the allowed files, preserve unrelated content and working-tree changes, and report its complete changed-file list. Review every edit in VS Code Source Control before testing.

### Automated and browser tests

```bash
cd "/Users/nicholasoconnell/Desktop/Portfolio-Dashboard/MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated"
pwd
git remote get-url origin
git diff --stat
git diff --check
# Run any phase-specific Node suites listed by the implementation package.
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open the applicable browser pages in Firefox:

- `http://localhost:8000/tests/ui-tests.html`
- `http://localhost:8000/tests/calculation-tests.html`

The test pages and manual checklist are primary evidence. Record exact results under `docs/test-results/`.

### Audit output requirements

Run the canonical audit prompt in a separate Codex review session. In addition to the phase-specific checks, require:

- Requirement traceability
- Complete changed-file list
- Automated test commands and results
- Manual tests still required
- Known limitations and environment limits
- Confirmation that no unapproved feature was added
- Exact file-level repairs and retest steps

### Review, commit, push, pull request, merge, and tag

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff
git diff --check
git add --all
git commit -m "Phase 9B: exports and reporting"
git push -u origin phase-9b-exports
```

In the GitHub web interface, create a pull request from the pushed phase branch to `main`, complete the pull-request evidence, wait for required checks, review the diff, then squash-merge and delete the remote branch. After merge:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git tag -a phase-9b-accepted -m "phase-9b-accepted accepted"
git push origin phase-9b-accepted
```

The tag triggers the milestone release workflow. Do not commit a routine ZIP.

### Rollback

Before merge, review the branch diff and preserve any work that may still be needed. Only if the owner explicitly approves discarding all unmerged branch work:

```bash
git switch main
git branch -D phase-9b-exports
```

After merge, use a new repair branch and `git revert <merge-commit>`; do not reset or force-push `main`.

## Phase notes

Use Phase 9A full backup for device transfer; configuration backup is the smaller convenience option.

## Canonical implementation prompt

```text
Build Phase 10A hardening increment.

Authoritative spec: requirements.md, Version 2.3.
Do not add new product features unless required to satisfy acceptance.

Tasks:
1. Vendor Apache ECharts into vendor/echarts/ and remove the runtime CDN dependency.
2. Update service-worker static caching to include the app shell, icons, and vendored assets with explicit cache versioning.
3. Do not precache user exports or IndexedDB content; caching static predefined-key configuration and provider URLs is permitted.
4. Implement safe cache upgrade and old-cache cleanup.
5. Confirm the app shell launches offline after a successful visit.
6. Confirm IndexedDB historical data, portfolio state, and cached quotes render when the Mac server is unavailable.
7. Distinguish Mac host unavailable, internet unavailable, Finnhub unavailable, stale cache, and local-history available states.
8. Add or verify StorageManager estimate, persisted status, persistence request, and clear warnings when unavailable.
9. Audit keyboard navigation, labels, landmarks, focus order, visible focus, dialog focus trapping, and announcements.
10. Audit high contrast and color-blind-safe chart distinctions.
11. Sanitize all user-entered text and avoid unsafe HTML rendering.
12. Audit predefined-key consistency, edit/reset behavior, persistence, diagnostics, exports, backups, URLs, and service-worker behavior.
13. Test Firefox on macOS Big Sur.
14. Test Mozilla Firefox browser and Home Screen modes on iPhone 13 mini, iOS 26.5.
15. Test portrait, landscape, safe-area insets, orientation change, touch gestures, file import, backup restore, and horizontal table scrolling.
16. Test Monte Carlo progress and cancellation for 1-, 5-, and 10-year horizons with 1,000, 2,500, and 5,000 paths on iPhone.
17. Benchmark approximately 8, 13, and 25 active symbols on the Mac without silently reducing correctness.
18. Test application update after service-worker cache-version change.
19. Test recovery documentation after browser storage loss.
20. Confirm no public hosting, remote access, router forwarding, backend, or cloud sync is required.
21. Save final performance, compatibility, and acceptance notes.

Edit only the authorized files in the current workspace, preserve unrelated changes, and report the complete changed-file list. Do not create a replacement project ZIP.
```

## Dependencies

- All prior phases accepted
- Complete test records
- Final local HTTPS and iPhone validation
- Final backup

## Required deliverables

- Final pass/fail requirements matrix
- Defect list grouped by severity
- Retest evidence
- Final accepted backup identifier
- Release decision

## Canonical implementation prompt

```text
Perform Phase 10B final audit.

Authoritative spec: requirements.md, Version 2.3.
Do not add new features unless required to correct a failed acceptance criterion.

Audit at minimum:
1. Private personal-use scope only.
2. No backend, cloud sync, public hosting, remote access, VPN requirement, or router port forwarding.
3. Approved Finnhub endpoints only; no /stock/candle.
4. Stooq history is private, split-adjusted, and dividend-unadjusted.
5. Complete-series manual historical replacement works transactionally.
6. Historical Data Service is the only analytical history interface.
7. Quote-only mode works when local history is missing.
8. Request queue enforces 60/minute, 30/second, priorities, bounded concurrency, and 429 backoff.
9. 25 active-symbol cap is enforced across holdings and benchmarks.
10. API key `[runtime-only owner entry]` is hardcoded as the default, committed, visible, editable, logged where useful, exported, backed up, and shown in diagnostics.
11. Holdings and lots add/edit/delete, preserve audit notes, and do not auto-apply corporate actions.
12. Built-in benchmarks can be deleted and re-added.
13. Deleting a benchmark does not affect a same-ticker holding.
14. Historical analytics are labeled split-adjusted, dividend-unadjusted price-return approximations.
15. Headline drawdown uses the Price-Return Performance Series.
16. GBM and Historical Bootstrap are the only MVP Monte Carlo methods.
17. Simulations use workers, progress, cancellation, seeds, and stale-run protection.
18. Charts render responsively and export PNG.
19. Projection horizon is globally consistent from 1 through 10 years.
20. Full portable backup and transactional restore work from Mac to iPhone.
21. API key is included in backup.
22. CSV and browser Print to PDF work.
23. Backup reminder rules are correct.
24. PWA launches offline after a successful visit.
25. Mac-host unavailable, internet unavailable, provider unavailable, stale, and local-history states are distinct.
26. Trusted same-Wi-Fi HTTPS and Home Screen installation work on iPhone 13 mini iOS 26.5.
27. iPhone portrait, landscape, safe areas, gestures, file import, restore, and Monte Carlo cancellation are tested.
28. Firefox/macOS Big Sur compatibility passes.
29. Accessibility and safe rendering basics pass.
30. Performance notes exist for the required symbol, horizon, and path-count combinations.
31. Every acceptance criterion in requirements.md is mapped to test evidence.
32. Every explicit non-goal remains excluded.

Output:
- A complete pass/fail matrix keyed to requirements sections.
- Defects grouped as blocking, important, or minor.
- Exact files and retest procedures for every failure.
- A final release recommendation: accept, accept with documented minor limitations, or reject.
- No speculative future features.

Edit only the authorized files in the current workspace, preserve unrelated changes, and report the complete changed-file list. Do not create a replacement project ZIP.
```

## 9.1 Deterministic fixture policy

- Use synthetic fixtures for committed parser and calculation tests.
- Use the eight private Stooq files for local acceptance testing.
- Keep expected calculation outputs explicit and independently verifiable.
- Never use a live API response as the sole proof of calculation correctness.
- Use `[runtime-only owner entry]` in tests where key behavior is under test.

## 9.2 Browser and device matrix

| Environment | Required use |
|---|---|
| Firefox on macOS Big Sur | Primary development and full functional acceptance |
| Mozilla Firefox on iPhone 13 mini browser mode | Network, import, layout, and compatibility tests |
| Mozilla Firefox Home Screen web-app mode | Final PWA, offline, safe-area, storage, and restore acceptance |
| Firefox on iOS | Secondary compatibility checks where practical |

# 10. GitHub Versioning, Backups, and Release Discipline

## 10.1 Git is the source-history system

- `main` contains accepted code.
- One branch and pull request are used per phase.
- Force pushes and deletion of `main` are blocked.
- Accepted phases receive annotated tags.
- Tags matching `phase-*-accepted` or `mvp-v*` trigger private release ZIP creation.
- Routine ZIP files remain ignored and uncommitted.

## 10.2 Accepted-phase records

Every accepted pull request shall record requirements version, phase, changed files, automated and browser tests, manual device evidence, limitations, audit result, merge commit, tag, and release URL.

## 10.3 Local and repository backups

GitHub source history does not replace browser-data backups. Continue creating and validating configuration and full portable backups. Under Version 2.3, the private repository may retain selected backups, exports, diagnostics, Stooq files, and accepted release packages, including the active Finnhub key.

## 10.4 Independent versions

Track application, Local Storage schema, IndexedDB schema, historical dataset, backup schema, service-worker cache, requirements, roadmap, Git commit, and accepted tag independently. Every version change requires a documented reason and migration or invalidation behavior.

## 10.5 Historical update records

Record source filename, source ticker, canonical symbol, hash, count, first/last dates, adjustment methodology, import mode and time, prior version, row differences, result, and diagnostics reference.

## 10.6 Final release

Before Phase 10B acceptance, create and verify the final source release, configuration backup, full portable backup, test evidence, final requirements audit, `mvp-v1.0` tag, and private GitHub release. The active Finnhub key may appear in these artifacts.

# 11. Mac-to-iPhone Operating Workflow

## 11.1 Initial installation

1. Complete Phase 1D on the target home Wi-Fi.
2. Start the private static HTTPS server on the Mac.
3. Open the stable HTTPS origin in Mozilla Firefox on the iPhone.
4. Confirm certificate trust and no warning.
5. Add the app to the Home Screen.
6. Launch the installed app.
7. Initialize using either the private seed installation or a full portable backup from the Mac.
8. Restore the saved Finnhub key on the iPhone, then edit or reset it if needed.
9. Request persistent storage where supported.
10. Export a new full backup after successful setup.

## 11.2 Routine use

- The Mac and iPhone use separate browser storage.
- Each device makes its own Finnhub and Treasury requests using the restored key or a local edit.
- The Mac does not proxy API calls.
- The installed iPhone app may use cached shell and IndexedDB data when the Mac server is unavailable.
- Live data still requires internet access and a Finnhub-accepted key.

## 11.3 Historical refresh

1. Download fresh complete Stooq files on the Mac.
2. Import through Phase 2D.
3. Review added, changed, removed, and unchanged records.
4. Confirm complete-series replacement.
5. Verify analytics and simulations are invalidated.
6. Run historical and calculation tests.
7. Export a new full portable backup.
8. Transfer through AirDrop or Files.
9. Restore transactionally on the iPhone.
10. Verify counts, hashes, date ranges, holdings, settings, and historical availability.

## 11.4 Offline behavior

When the Mac server is stopped after successful installation:

Available on iPhone:

- Cached application shell
- Saved holdings, lots, benchmarks, and settings
- Local historical charts and analytics
- Monte Carlo from local data
- Cached quote snapshots with stale labels
- Backup export

Unavailable or limited:

- Application updates from the Mac
- Reinstallation after browser data loss
- Uncached static assets
- New Finnhub and Treasury data when internet is unavailable

# 13. Prompt Execution Rules

1. Read `MVP-Portfolio-Dash-3A-Validated/requirements.md` Version 2.3 from the active project root before every implementation or audit.
2. Use only the active phase packet and allowed-file list.
3. Keep VS Code on the named phase branch and have Codex inspect the current workspace files rather than relying on stale pasted or attached copies.
4. State the accepted dependency interfaces that must not change.
5. Use the predefined key `[runtime-only owner entry]` where key behavior is relevant.
6. Instruct Codex to edit only authorized workspace files and report its complete changed-file list.
7. Do not request or accept a complete replacement ZIP for routine phase work.
8. Run implementation and audit in separate Codex sessions.
9. Require browser tests, manual tests, and environment limitations to be distinguished from automated passes.
10. Require requirement traceability, changed files, automated results, remaining manual tests, limitations, no-new-features confirmation, and exact repairs in every audit.
11. Apply changes on the named phase branch, inspect diffs, and never copy over `.git`.
12. Do not merge while the browser checklist, required device evidence, audit, or Actions checks are incomplete.
13. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, project status, and test evidence in the same pull request.
14. Tag every accepted merge and verify the milestone release package.
15. Use a new repair branch and `git revert` for post-merge defects; never force-push `main`.
16. When requirements and current code conflict, identify the conflict and implement the approved migration before dependent work.
17. Do not add unapproved features, providers, architecture, hosting, or automatic synchronization.
